Absolutely useless project developed in result of having too much free time.
Main idea of project was playing real AAA productions in Minecraft.

Plugin uses Windows API to fetch content of specified frame, then converts it to array of bytes and sends to clients.

Also, there is way to implement custom `IMapRenderer` and create some sort of GUI.
You might already seen something similar on Hypixel Minecraft server.
